# My story

Back in 2007, I had my first exposure to FP, under the form of
a university course. The course taught us OCaml.

------------------

Being focused on data structures  and algorithm, and not on the
"real world", I did lack the motivation of building things in it.

------------------

As a young undergraduate, I caught the OOP fever shortly after,
and didn't look at OCaml again, despite finding it fascinating.

------------------

The fact my university was (**is**) mono-culture (i.e. Java), together with
my refuse of the _status quo_, pushed me to "greener pastures", where
I found Python, falling in love with it.

------------------

## Fast-forward 2009..

I was still in love with Python. At the time I was a regular attendees of
**Python-it.org**, a popular Italian community.

------------------

The "off-topic" forum room was the place where we talked about technology and
every non-related Python topic, and more than once, a user I respected mentioned
Scheme and its cousin **Clojure**.

------------------

I fell in love with Clojure.

------------------

Pushing myself forward in my holy grail search, I was exposed to a huge number of
programming language, trying to find the "perfect" one: Scheme, Clojure, Common Lisp,
**Haskell**, Io, Ruby, _put-yet-another-language-here_. I did look at Haskell with
interest, but I find it quite arcane. I did order and started reading the "Real World
Haskell" book, but I found it disappointing (at the time): "Why on earth did I need to
wrap my values inside this _Just_ thing, if then I need to unwrap it to inspect the value?"
- I thought at time.

------------------

So, despite the interest, I did went back to Clojure and lisp-family languages.

------------------

## Fast-forward 2011..

When the time of choosing my master degree's project, I had no doubt but asking to my
professor Franco, which at the time was teaching "Parallel and Distributed Computing".
I was extremely intrigued by the topic, and Franco revamped in me the holy flame of
fast and compiled languages. So he said "Use C++, and live long and prosper".
